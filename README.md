# SMNER
The code of the paper: An Effective Span-based Multimodal Named Entity Recognition with
Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment

# Note!!!
Please note: Due to many interested individuals consulting the code recently, we have not yet had the time to organize the files, so the current version may have bugs. However, this will not affect the understanding of the model, and we will also strive to improve our code files as soon as possible.
